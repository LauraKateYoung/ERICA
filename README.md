</div>


## Description
ERICA is a simulation tool for generating synthetic high resolution *en face* images of the human cone mosaic based on the data capture through an adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope. Synthetic images with corresponding ground truth data are useful for testing, training and validating image processing and analysis tools, such as for cell detection, eye movement extraction and montaging. ERICA is comprised of three main modules to:

1. Generate a self-organising mosaic of cone cells
2. Simulate movements of the eye made during the image capture
3. Replicate the data capture, including the effects of diffraction, noise and residual aberrations

**ERICA will be released alongside our publication shortly - watch this space!**
